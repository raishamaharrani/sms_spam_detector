# sms_spam_detector
In this challenge we had to complete two tasks 

Task 1 = Refactor code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model.

Task 2 = To create a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.
